TODO
- Persist "last used folder ID"
- What about fanart?
- From http://kodi.wiki/view/Add-on_rules:
	- all strings used by add-ons must be localized, no hard-coded language strings should ever be used

DONE
- Get real URL from PCloud's streaming API
- Add settings dialog for username & password
- Persist auth
- See what happens if one opens the settings page directly from the Kodi plugin page (maybe need to handle the notif?)
	- For example test with bad username or password
- Figure out a way to reload the main page once settings have been set for the first time
- Add real thumbnails to files and (maybe) to folders
