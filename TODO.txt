TODO
- Add real thumbnails to files and (maybe) to folders
	- What about fanart?
- Persist "last used folder ID"

DONE
- Get real URL from PCloud's streaming API
- Add settings dialog for username & password
- Persist auth
- See what happens if one opens the settings page directly from the Kodi plugin page (maybe need to handle the notif?)
	- For example test with bad username or password
- Figure out a way to reload the main page once settings have been set for the first time
